This is a set of tools I've written to make writing games easier in Unity3D.

The entire system allows for

- Loading sprite sheets to a quad
- Animating sprites
- Defining animated states
- Tweening
- Chaining Tweens and other "MachineStates" together
- Concurrent queues of MachineStates to execute

There are two main components

AnimatedSprite 
	A Base class for animated objects which you can load from a sprite sheet

MachineQueue/MachineState
	Control and manage the execution of machine states and their callback
	an animated object can execute multiple MachineQueues at once.
